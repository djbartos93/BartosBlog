Hi! My name is Eric, I am a broadcast engineer at Wisconsin Public Radio. I have been in the world of broadcasting since 2012,
Starting at the Michigan Tech radio station WMTU.

My love of broadcasting really started my second year of college, and my second year at WMTU. I started to become more and more
involved with the way everything worked and how audio went from the microphone to the top of the tower. With each day bringing new challenges
I feel it is very important to have good information or ideas readily accessible.

That is part of the reason why I started this blog, to share my thoughts and ideas on current broadcasting technology and trends as well as share
my experiences. I work on tons of different projects at work and at home, I hope to be able to share what I learn and compile from other sources
into one spot on this blog.

In addition to projects, and broadcast related things, I plan to occasionally share some travel experiences and some general thoughts and things on
technology and the world of engineering. I also hope to have some guest writers to help me out with topics that I may not be very well versed on. Starting off I plan to write at least one post a week on here, so feel free to subscribe to my RSS feed or shoot me an email from my contact form and I will add you to my email list!

Oh I almost forgot, I cross-post everything on here to my [Medium Puiblication](https://medium.com/aircheck) if you would rather subscribe to that or would rather read things over there.
