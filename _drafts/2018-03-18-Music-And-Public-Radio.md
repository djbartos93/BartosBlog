Welcome to the second post on Aircheck! I was planning on doing a less opinonated post for my first real thing, but this has just been at the front of my mind recently so here we go! This post is nothing but my opinion on the matter, if you have thoughts or anything to say head to that comment section and lets discuss, I'd love to hear what everyone else thiks about this!

# Music + Public Radio = Awesome

Every single time I look for in studio performences of bands I head on youtube and go right to the KEXP youtube. If its not on KEXP, there are a few other places I like to check out for the same thing, The Current is a great one, as well as Tiny Desk if I want something more acoustic or _raw_. While there is no shortage of thse recordings, I want to se more, like a lot more, like 10 times as much. Why? Because I love music, I love seeing the artists in different settings and at different times in there carrere or during a tour or something. I look for this because they are doing something I have always wanted to be part of, they have awesome artists come into the studio, have a chat, and perform! Its awesome. And it's something that can be done anywhere to bring more new music into the spotlight. 

The reason I bring this up specifically for public radio is because of the freedom that is given to a public radio station, they are not owned by some coorperate giant station that controls every aspect of the programing. They have the _freedom_ to whatever they want with programing, meaning music, talk, classical music, whatever! they can do it all! The other cool part about public radio doing things like this is the huge reach they have, there are [_thousands_](https://www.npr.org/stations/pdf/nprstations.pdf) of public radio stations across the US, many states have several stations with different programming to fit each section of the state! This is so powerful, I dont think some of the directors of these stations really understand the power of the stations they run, some do, but not all. The really cool part is the link up there does not include small local stations, just stations that are NPR members. So there are more stations that could be doing this type of thing than I can even comprehend. With all that in mind, lets move on to the next big thing that has me writing this article.

# Lack of Music in Public radio

Yes, even with the large number of public radio stations, there is still a **huge** lack of public radio stations doing cool things with mucsic. There are several stations that play music, but it is mostly classical and there is nothing wrong with that, it totally has its place, but most stations have times when they play syndicated news or repeated programs, these could easily be replaced with new, hip, indie music! And **that** is the whole point of this post.
