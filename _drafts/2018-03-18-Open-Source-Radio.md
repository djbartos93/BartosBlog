# Lets Talk Open Source

Welcome everyone to my second ever blog post here on Aircheck, today I want to talk about something that has been bothering me for the last few years, and that is the overall lack of open source software in radio engineering. 

For those who may not know, Open source software is, taken form the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/faq#osd) FAQ Page titled "What Is "Open Source" software?" 
> "Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition."

If you would like more information on what exactly defines something as open source check out [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd)

So now that we have that out of the way and you are well versed in the ways of what is open source, I am going to break this post down into some sections ************

## Automation Systems

One of the most critical systems in any radio station is an automation system, unless you have hosts or DJs in your studio 24/7 you need some kind of automation system. Now speaking from experiance these systems can be very expensive! Now I'm sure before I even get to my point some of you are saying "BUT ERIC! Automation needs to be commercial software, close source so it WORKS!". And thats when I say "Well...Yes, but not quite."

I see why there isnt a huge market for open source radio automation systems, since it is such an important system in any radio station it does need to be reliable, but open source **does not** mean the software is unreliable or unstable! Look at CentOS, a major Linux distrobution run in many datacenters, completely 100% open source. Another perfect example Apache Web server, 100% open source and in my experiance 100% stable. So stop with that argument that I have seen times than I can count, just stop. If developers take the time needed to write the software it will work the same if it were open source or closed source. 

Getting back to the topic at hand, automation systems. Yes there are free systems out there but off the top of my head I can only thing of **ONE** that is actually open source: Rivendell. You can even go take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/ElvishArtisan/rivendell) right now on git hub! Now I can think of a few _free_ automation systems: [Radio DJ](http://www.radiodj.ro/), [PlayIt Live](https://www.playitsoftware.com/Products/Live) (while it has paid modules, the main software is free), and a few others are just a google search away. I did look for the source code for Radio DJ, but I ended up finding [this forum post](http://www.radiodj.ro/community/index.php?topic=8119.0) stating that Radio DJ is **not** open source. To me, this is a huge bummer, because I have used the software and I have some friends who could probably fix some major problems I had.


Now its your turn: I'd love for anyone to take a second and comment with any software that you have used in your time working in radio or TV really or any broadcasting field that is **truly** open source. And by that I mean you can go download the source code and make changes. Not just software that is free to download and use.
