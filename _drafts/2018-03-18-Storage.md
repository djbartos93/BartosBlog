Welcome to my second post on Aircheck, and the first installment of a larger series covering storage for everything audio! Something that it seems nobody can agree on is how to properly store audio files for recording, backup and archiving. Today we will dive into part 1 of this series covering the basics of drive types and RAID arrays. We will also cover what you need to get started for a proper audio workstation storage setup.

In part 2. I will go into more detail about backup and archival solutions and I may even run into a part 3 covering some large-scale storage for more than just audio. Let’s get started with part 1!

# Drive and Array Types

There is a ton of great info on the internet about drive types and array types, so rather than going into crazy detail about each technology I will be talking about in this series, I have compiled some of the more important storage terms. Now these are wiki links to help you get started if you dont have any clue about storage, if you already know about all this stuff go ahead and skip to the next section.

* [Solid State Drive (SSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)
* [Hard Disk Drive (HDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)
* [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID)
  - [Standard RAID Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#Standard_levels)
* [Storage Area Network (SAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network)
* [Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI)
* [Fiber Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel)
* [Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Attached_SCSI)
* [Serial ATA (SATA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA)


### Normal Use Storage



I consider anything normal use to be the drives in your desktop that you boot off. Focusing commercially available desktops from Dell or other manufactures, most will come with at least a 500GB internal hard drive standard and nothing else. Generally, there is an upgrade option for a solid-state drive for a boost in performance. One thing to note is while most Windows desktops come standard with Hard Drives, most recent Mac computers come standard with Solid State and some can’t even be changed. Unless you are building a [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh), these suggestions only apply to computers that you can open up and work on.

#### RAID?

One of the biggest questions that I see on the internet is if you should use RAID in your desktop. In my opinion RAID is critical when using your desktop for anything other than word processing or browsing the internet. My reasoning behind this is if you are like me, and have any kind of audio, photo, or video editing setup on your workstation, there was a _ton_ of work put into getting your system running well and setup properly. without RAID if your drive goes bad, all that work is down the drain.

Most motherboards support simple RAID, most likely RAID 0 or RAID 1. If you forgot, or didn’t browse my links up above, RAID 0 is striping, and RAID 1 is mirroring. For 99.9999% of your workstation/desktop use RAID 1 is the way to go. I have learned from personal experience that RIAD 0 is bad.

One thing to consider when going RAID is the built in "controller" on most motherboards really doesn’t give you much in terms of performance increases, if you do use the built-in controller, or worse software RAID, you should remember this will **only** help with redundancy and not performance. In addition, if you want to do anything above RAID 1 in a desktop (honestly why would you want to?) you are going to need a controller to handle that, and I will go into more detail about controllers in the next few sections so if that is something you want to do, hang tight we'll get there.

Looking at my personal setup for a second here, I have 2x 120GB solid state drives in RAID 1 because I absolutely hate having to re-install my system. I am running with the built in "controller" on my motherboard and it seems to be working just fine for my use.

You may also be asking "well what do I do if I have a mac?!" don’t worry! there are plenty of options out there for storage on your mac. While you can’t do RAID on the OS drive, there are backup solutions that will solve the problem of a complete system wipe or drive failure. I will go into more detail on that in part 2 of this series when we talk about backups.

### Recording Derives & Configurations

Here is where we start talking more specifically about Audio/Video/Production systems and how to get the most out of your drive setup. Each use case will need to be tweaked just a bit from my experience. What I am going to discuss in this section is a great starting point for anyone who is serious about the performance and data reliability in their production system.

#### System Drive vs. Scratch Drive

</figure>
When recording or editing audio or video it is critical to not use your system drive for storing the files you are working with, this will cause a major performance hit and in severe cases lock up your whole computer. You always want _some_ kind of scratch drive or to work from.

Taking another look at my setup, I have my RAID SSD setup for the OS and programs, and I have an internal 1TB enterprise grade hard drive as my scratch drive. Ideally this would be a SSD, but it wasn't in the budget for this build. This drive is _not_ my primary project storage it is just a drive to keep the projects I am working on.

And that’s another key to having the scratch drive, that it is not your primary project storage, it should only be used for the projects you have open or are actively editing. If you go this route, you must be sure to back up your scratch drive every time you are done with editing to 100% prevent any data loss. When it comes to a scratch drive it shouldn't be the end of the world if the drive fails, just your most recent edits.

If you are particularly worried about data loss, you can go and get an external RAID array, I particularly like the options that Glyph has, like the [Studio RAID Thunderbolt](https://www.glyphtech.com/product/studioraid-tb2-thunderbolt2-0).

#### Project Storage

Now that you have your desktop with your RAID SSDs and your scratch drive, you will need storage for all those projects that you aren't actively working on! This is where we can get a little bit creative with our storage to make something awesome.

There are TONS of external hard drives out there that you can use for project storage, and really any of them will work just fine. But if you don’t want to sit there and wait days for a project to transfer from scratch to storage there are a few drives that I would recommend to have. First Anything from the Glyph studio, or Black Box line. They are either SSD or 7200+ RPM drives that won’t keep you waiting. Another is the LaCie Big series for raid and the d2 series for a single disk. You can also go crazy and build your own storage drive with an [OWC Enclosure](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/hard-drives/External-Enclosures/3.5-Inch-Drives) and any drive that is 7200+ RPM.

For this storage, solid state is not really needed, since you won’t be accessing it as much as you would be if you were editing some audio or video. It’s just important to have a decently fast drive that can hold most or all of your projects.

I have had a few ideas over the years on how to handle project storage. I started off thinking it was a good idea to just buy small drives for each project or artist that would be coming in the studio to storing it in the _cloud_. None of those ideas worked, trust me keeping projects in the cloud is not a good idea. The one solution I have settled on is to use a combination of a NAS, and a 2TB RAID 1 enclosure. I chose an enclosure because it didn’t need to be running all the time, and I decided to go with RAID since I _really_ couldn’t have any data loss between backups. I bring up my NAS because sometimes I do have to make room for new projects or backups of my scratch drive and at that point, I will take the oldest (not in use) project and dump it onto my NAS. In part 2 I will go into more detail on how a NAS fits into the ideal storage setup but for now it’s just part of project storage.

That about wraps up part 1 of this series, hopefully you have a better idea on how to handle your audio/video storage for working projects. As always you will need to think about what solutions work best in your setup. While I can give examples on how I do storage, it is important to take everything you need into account when setting up your ideal storage system.

I would love to hear what you think is the best way to do storage (not backups yet, that’s part 2) Leave a comment with some of your thoughts or [tweet](https://tiwtter.com/erbartos) at me!
